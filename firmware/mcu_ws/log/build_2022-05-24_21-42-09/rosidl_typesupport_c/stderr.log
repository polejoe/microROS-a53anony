CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpoco_vendor.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "poco_vendor", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "poco_vendor" with
  any of the following names:

    poco_vendorConfig.cmake
    poco_vendor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "poco_vendor" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "poco_vendor_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "poco_vendor" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

  support dynamic linking.  Building a STATIC library instead.  This may lead
  to problems.
